Coding Style:
 * Indententation: four spaces, no tabs.
 * Braces: On the lines below if,where,etc... statements.
 * Function declarations: return type goes on the first line, function name
    and first parameter on the second line.  Second and further parameters
    each get their own line, and they should be aligned with the start of
    the first parameter.  Please do not add spaces between the type and
    variable name to line up the variable names.  As specified before, the
    opening brace also gets its own line.
    If the function has no arguments, specify (void) in the declaration.
 * Comparisons: put constants on the left-side of the comparison, when the
    comparison is accidently replaced by an assignment, the compiler will
    warn about it.

 * Parentheses: always put spaces around parentheses in for,while,switch
    and if statements. Functions and macro's are different, only put spaces 
    around the arguments, but keep the '(' against the function or macro
    name.

 * EXAMPLES:
    if ( NULL == ptr )
    {
    }
