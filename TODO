Summary:
  ... a lot

Long Version:

  Implement archive-type verification and 'open' support for existing archives
    - done for tar
               tar.gz
               tar.bz2

	Implement 'NewArchiveDialog'

	Implement 'ExtractArchiveDialog'

  Implement transaction-options for archive-support objects
  Implement transaction-options for compression-support objects
    (use g_object_class_properties for that?)

  Let support objects check if the program in question exists upon object creation.

	add configure-options to enable / disable support-objects.

  Optimize memory usage and library size (remove duplicate code)

  Extend testing: 
    Test Add
         Remove
         Extract
         View
  

  See if we can avoid using /tmp when possible.
  Write view support for gnu-tar support object.
