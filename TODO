  ... a lot

Long Version:
  Implement archive-type verification and 'open' support 
  for existing archives

  Write view support for gnu-tar support object.

	Let support objects check if the program in question exists upon object creation.

  Implement transaction-options for archive-support objects
  Implement transaction-options for compression-support objects

  Extend testing: 
    Test Add
         Remove
         Extract
         View
	
  Optimize memory usage and library size (remove duplicate code)

  See if we can avoid using /tmp when possible.
