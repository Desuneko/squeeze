  Make thunar-vfs dependency optional.
  Make libxfce4-util dependency optional.

	Add Accelerators to Notebook

  Add Dialog

  New Dialog 

  Open Dialog 

	MenuBar

  Settings support

	DnD

	Non-default actions

  Comment library functions
    (explain their purpose)

  Increase performance

  Implement multi-threading (for libarchive support)

	In archive store, on delete in parent dir of current entry, check if map still exists, if not move to the ancestor that still exists

	In treeview, when going to up dir, select the dir you came from

	When retrieving selected items from the treeview, forget the updir item
	Add trailing '/' to folder filenames when getting it from treeview

	Add 'View' support, with internal optional internal or external viewer.

	Let Tab-labels change style on archive-status.

	Add progressbar to statusbar.

	Support CustomActionProperties (custom-actions which require additional arguments and configuration) Make them class actions insteadof instance actions structs

	An Archive should only be opened once

	Check to see if the [<] and [>] of the pathbar needs point in the other direction when TEXT_DIR_RTL is set

  ... Complete TODO-file

BUGS:

	Archive does not get freed properly. (mem usage keeps growing when opening and closing same archive)

	History inside the archive-store is bugged. This shows in archive_store_get_pwd.

	archive-store out-of-sync is buffer-flush... breaks on index 499800: 499800.0 / 300.0 (buffer-size) == 1666.0 remaining 199 items are not flushed

DONE:

  Fix navigation-bars to work with notebook - DONE

  Close Buttons - DONE

	Fix Command-line options - DONE

	Toggle navigationbar at runtime - DONE
